### Want to add a new product to the list

Here's a good review that came from another item. Not necessarily as many funny comments here but I'd like to add some from different sources from time to time

Shin Ramyun is edible life essence. Last month I made a down payment on a new mansion, met Wiz Khalifa, bought a new Ferrari in cash, earned back-to-back pentakills with Kassadin, won four consecutive lotteries, tied the knot with my girlfriend, uninstalled Vim, helped my best friend deliver his firstborn child, hit my deadlift PR of 9,001 lbs, realized that I am Jeff Bezos's son, and had a bowl of Shin Ramyun. The only thing that brought me any semblance of emotion was the Shin Ramyun. By the way, that's the only thing I ate last month, and I feel better than I've felt in centuries. Shin Ramyun is the only medicine that will save us from the vile haze of chemtrails.
